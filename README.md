# Hirst-Painting
Python script to demonstrate Hirst painting using turtle graphics.

The Hirst spot painting is a hallmark of Damien Hirst's work, characterized by its vibrant, repetitive circles of color on a white background. Each spot is meticulously painted in various hues, creating a sense of rhythm and visual harmony. This art form explores themes of chance, order, and the relationship between color and perception, challenging traditional notions of artistic originality and craftsmanship. In this project, we delve into the visual and conceptual elements of Hirst's spot paintings, analyzing their impact on contemporary art and culture.
